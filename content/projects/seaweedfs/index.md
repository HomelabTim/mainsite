# Introduction

Join me on a fascinating journey into the world of SeaweedFS, as I recount my experiences working with AI Media Group to harness the potential of this innovative file storage system. In this blog post, I will guide you through the installation process and share insights into creating a `master` server, highlighting the benefits gained and how this knowledge propels me forward in my future endeavors.

## What is SeaweedFS

SeaweedFS is a distributed file system designed to efficiently store and manage large volumes of data across clusters of servers. It provides a simple yet powerful solution for storing files by distributing them across multiple nodes, enabling seamless scalability and fault tolerance. SeaweedFS utilizes a `master-server` architecture to manage metadata and coordinate storage operations, while individual `volume` servers handle the actual data storage. With its lightweight design and straightforward setup process, SeaweedFS is a versatile solution suitable for various applications, from content distribution to data archiving and beyond.

## Installing SeaweedFS

The first step on this adventure is installing SeaweedFS on your system.

**SeaweedFS Github Page:**
{{< github repo="seaweedfs/seaweedfs" >}}

**Utilize the following commands to seamlessly set up SeaweedFS:**

```bash
wget https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/releases/download/3.61/linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv weed /usr/local/bin
```

**To verify the installation, run:**

```bash
weed version
```

**You should see an output similar to this:**

`version 30GB 3.61 linux amd64`

## Creating a Master Server

For optimal performance, it's crucial to set up the `master` server on a separate machine from the `volumes`. Run this command to create a `master` server:

```bash
weed master -port=9333
```

{{< alert "lightbulb" >}}
**Pro Tip:** Remember the IP of the master server from here on I will reference it as `0.0.0.0:9333`
{{< /alert >}}

## Creating the Volume Server

1. **Initialize the proper directory:**

```bash
sudo mkdir /path/to/your/volume/
```

2. **Connect a volume to the master by running the following command:**

```bash
weed volume -dir=/path/to/your/volume/ -mserver=0.0.0.0:9333 -port=8101 -ip=1.1.1.1 -dataCenter=datacentername -rack=rackname -max=0
```

{{< alert "lightbulb" >}}
**Pro Tip:** `1.1.1.1` | `datacentername` | `rackname` are all a reference to items that need to be changed please change all items to whatever you like `1.1.1.1` is the volume server
{{< /alert >}}

## Running Multiple Volume Directories

To enhance storage capacity, consider running more than one `volume` directory. Use the following commands as a template:

## Using systemd to run multiple volume directories

Create a service named `sw1.service` (**seaweed1 service**)

**To learn more about systemd and what I have done with it view my blog on [Systemd](https://portfolio.homelabtim.com/projects/systemd)**

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
nano sw1.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=seaweed vol service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/root/sw1.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create the `sw1.sh` (**seaweed1**)

```bash
cd /
nano sw1.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
weed volume -dir=/path/to/your/volume/ -mserver=0.0.0.0:9333 -port=8101 -ip=1.1.1.1 -dataCenter=datacentername -rack=rackname -max=0
```

{{< alert "lightbulb" >}}
**Pro Tip:** To make it more than one volume add multiple `.sh` and `.service` files 
{{< /alert >}}
